# DiffusionDB Faces Dataset

This repo contains a set of images saved by applying [Images With Faces Filter](https://github.com/yebrandon/images-with-faces-filter) to [DiffusionDB Images Dataset](https://github.com/yebrandon/diffusiondb-image-dataset). The result is a set of 240 images originating from DiffusionDB's "2m_random_1k" subset  that have had faces detected in them.
